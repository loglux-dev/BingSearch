# Bing News Scraper

This repository contains a Python script that uses the Playwright library to scrape news articles from Bing News based on a specified query. The script is designed to be asynchronous and efficiently handles multiple pages of news results through automated scrolling.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Scraping**: Utilizes the `asyncio` library and Playwright's asynchronous API to perform non-blocking operations.
- **Automated Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls through Bing News search results to load more articles.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts headlines, URLs, publication dates, and snippets for each news article.
- **Duplicate Filtering**: Ensures that only unique articles are added to the results list.

## Usage

To use the script, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with the required dependencies. You can install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install playwright
```

Then, install the browser binaries needed by Playwright:
            
    ```bash
    python -m playwright install
    ```
## Running the Script
```bash
python -m asyncio get_bing_news.py
```
```python
query = '"google"+"cloud"'
asyncio.run(fetch_bing_news(query=query, max_scrolls=20, scroll_pause=2000))
```

- **query**: The search query to fetch news articles (use URL-encoded format for special characters).
- **max_scrolls**: Maximum number of times the page will be scrolled to load additional articles.
- **scroll_pause**: Time in milliseconds to wait after each scroll to allow new articles to load.
